_Experiment: Game agent learning to defeat Monstro (The Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth+)_

## Background

The project was born out of admiration for / frustration with [OpenAI Universe](https://github.com/openai/universe). The idea is perfect, let's be honest, but some implementation details leave a lot to be desired. From these, the core tennets of the framework were established:

1. Thou shall run natively. Thou shalt not use Docker containers or VNC servers.
2. Thou shall allow a user to bring their own games. Thou shalt not wait for licensing deals and special game APIs.
3. Thou shall encourage diverse and creative approaches. Thou shalt not only enable AI flavors of the month.
